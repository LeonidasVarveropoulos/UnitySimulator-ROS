# UnitySimulator-ROS
This repository is a Unity simulator that works alongside the ROS code in order to accurately simulate robot control. The code running on the physical robot and alongside the simulator are the same. The project above is the complete simulator without the CAD models due to their large file size. For more information, documentation, and the ROS robot code look at the [robot-frc](https://github.com/LeonidasVarveropoulos/robot-frc) repository.

This was done using the [ros-sharp](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp) library.
