# UnitySimulator-ROS
The goal of this repository is to provide a working example and framework of an FRC robot using ROS to other teams, so that they too can explore the advantages of ROS. This repository hosts the ROS code from the 2020 FRC Season Robot created by [FRC Team 624](http://team624.org/) and is configured for the game Infinite Recharge with certain sensors. However, it is **not** difficult to implement your own sensors and game specific content into this framework. When testing on a non-FRC robot, the proxy node can be replaced to interface with your hardware. If you are interested in learning how to get ROS working for yourself with a simulator and the physical robot or looking for a more detailed documentation, check out the [ROS wiki](https://github.com/LeonidasVarveropoulos/robot-frc/wiki) of this repository.
